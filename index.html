            I am a psuedo-electrical engineer based in Belleville. I initially
            began my journey as an entrepreneur, focusing primarily in
            e-commerece with a product specialization of consumer electronics.
            The products that my company was selling were mainly items that
            needed to be tested or subsequently repaired. As a small company, I
            then needed to learn how to perform repair on basic electronics,
            this lead me to working in a company repairing vehicle electronics,
            creating test rigs for various makes/models of vehicles, and
            understanding the intrinsic knowledge needed to progress.

            I have been in the Army Reserves for almost six years at this point.
            While it has lead me to experiences that range vastly on the
            "Enjoyable" scale, here are a few images of the most enjoyable
            experiences:

              I only included this as I thought it was interesting that this
              broke the function and created the Droste effect. In other words,

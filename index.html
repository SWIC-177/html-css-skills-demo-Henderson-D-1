        There are few interesting aspects of my life, here they are:

      <p class="mb-4">
        I am a psuedo-electrical engineer based in Belleville. I initially began
        my journey as an entrepreneur, focusing primarily in e-commerece with a
        product specialization of consumer electronics. The products that my
        company was selling were mainly items that needed to be tested or
        subsequently repaired. As a small company, I then needed to learn how to
        perform repair on basic electronics, this lead me to working in a
        company repairing vehicle electronics, creating test rigs for various
        makes/models of vehicles, and understanding the intrinsic knowledge
        needed to progress.

        I have been in the Army Reserves for almost six years at this point.
        While it has lead me to experiences that range vastly on the "Enjoyable"
        scale, here are a few images of the most enjoyable experiences:

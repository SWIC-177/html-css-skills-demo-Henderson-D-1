          There are few interesting aspects of my life, here they are:

            I am a psuedo-electrical engineer based in Belleville. I initially
            began my journey as an entrepreneur, focusing primarily in
            e-commerece with a product specialization of consumer electronics.
            The products that my company was selling were mainly items that
            needed to be tested or subsequently repaired. As a small company, I
            then needed to learn how to perform repair on basic electronics,
            this lead me to working in a company repairing vehicle electronics,
            creating test rigs for various makes/models of vehicles, and
            understanding the intrinsic knowledge needed to progress.

            I have been in the Army Reserves for almost six years at this point.
            While it has lead me to experiences that range vastly on the
            "Enjoyable" scale, here are a few images of the most enjoyable
            experiences:

            <p class="ml">
              These images were all taken in the same place, in California.
              While Death Valley was interesting, I definitely prefer Camp
              Pendleton much more as it was near San Diego and, more
              importantly, the beach.

              This is my first attempt with grids, this has kind of been the
              worst part of this assignment for me, aside from my Tailwind
              abilities not being in full force as I cannot "initialize" things
              like hover: and so forth. I wish I had a few more images with
              higher resolution as that is also limiting me at this point as
              well.

            Here are also a few pictures of my office! I am currently finishing
            my basement and am close to completion. As a former contractor, I do
            a little at a time whenever I am free to do so, which isn't often.
            This office was my third biggest project with this house, as I
            opened up all 4 walls and ran CAT-6 ethernet as well as wire to
            sections of wall without easy access to receptacles. My office has a
            network box with a network switch and serves as a hub to the rest of
            the house as well, there is a second main hub in my basement as
            well. My house is semi-haunted by the previous owner, I will discuss
            that in a future assignment!

              excuse to play with it. In other words, RKS just dropped a new
